This file describes the basic structure of the GNUmakefile for module 
directories such as util/

Overview:
* NAME=...
* include ../system/make.libs
* prelink (optional)
* special rules

-------------------------------------------------------

*** NAME=libsx...
describes the name of the archive to be created without any extension like 
.a or .so, but with the preceding "lib".

Each module must have a unique name. It must be all lowercase. In general,
new modules must be configured (described elsewhere). The part after the
-l in the configuration is the part after lib for NAME.

Example:
module "util":
in configuration (SXLIBS) -lsxutil
in util/GNUmakefile       libsxutil
in lib/ directory         libsxutil.a (or libsxutil.so for shared libraries)

------------------------------------------------------

*** include ../system/make.libs
Here, all the rules to generate libraries (as well as add-ons) are imported.
General rules go to that file, directory-specific rules come AFTER the include.

------------------------------------------------------

*** prelink: ...
Here, prelinkable object files are listed for the 
configure --enable-fastlink 
option. In general, this is restricted to low-level wrapper function 
files/classes that hide numeric/io libraries from the developer. In the
prelinking, these external libraries are already linked with the wrapper
functions, which hopefully speeds up the linking. This is experimental.
If you are in doubt, do not put your object file here.

------------------------------------------------------
**** special rules
Special rules may be necessary for certain files in some directories.
