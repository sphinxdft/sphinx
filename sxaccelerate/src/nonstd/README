All S/PHI/nX classes are compiled with a rather high compiler warning
level. ANSI and POSIX standards are requested by S/PHI/nX default 
compiler switches.
Some operating systems (like Windows) provide some necessary or useful
functions which disobey ANSI/POSIX. Hence, if compiled with the
corresponding compiler flags these (useful) functions are no longer 
available. Hence, we have to following options:
  1. reduce the compiler warning level throughout the code
  2. do not offer some useful features on those platforms
  3. keep the high compiler warning level and compile the wrappers separately.

The 1st choice is unacceptable. The 2nd choice is implemented via
configure switches. In order to implement the last item this SxCommOS 
binding file has been introduced. It is compiled without any compiler
warning switches.
